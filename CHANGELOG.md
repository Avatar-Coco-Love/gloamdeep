# Changelog

Newest first. Every PR adds exactly one entry, and that entry is the
version bump. The same lines go, word for word, into the in-game Version
history, `src/core/history-0.3.js` (D-254, D-528).

Versions:
- `0.0.x`: pre-production (decisions, docs, art studies). No playable game.
- `0.1.x`: foundation. The first code, built up one small visible step at a time.
- `0.2.x`: stage 0.2, from step 32: places with character, a dive worth
  repeating, and stronger, slowly (D-159).
- `0.3.x`: stage 0.3, the world (D-168), from 0.3.0, once stage 0.2's
  last steps were done (D-528).
- Later minor versions (`0.4`…) are set when the build plan in
  `docs/PROGRESS.md` defines the next stage.
- `1.0.0`: the first release the owner calls finished.

Entry format:

```
## 0.0.2 (2026-10-18)
- One line per change, written so the owner can follow it.
- Decisions: D-008. Questions closed: Q-001.
```

## 0.3.257 (2026-11-10)
- Behind the scenes: the Growth tree is getting ready to grow. Its upgrades are now one list, each with its cost, how many times it can be bought and its look, and your save keeps one record of what you bought. Nothing you see changes: your hearts, Tough and Steady Wick stay yours. Next, the tree's new look, its rows as twigs with small picture tiles side by side; then the Hands upgrade.
- Decisions: D-811.

## 0.3.256 (2026-11-10)
- New: the Mole Claw Pick, the Mole Claw's first use. The workbench's BUILD tab makes it from 1 Mole Claw, 2 Wood and 2 Stone: the Stone Pick's handle with a mole's pale claw as its head. Hold it in the Tool slot and it does all the Stone Pick does, faster: a copper vein breaks in 2 bumps, not 4, and rubble clears in 2, not 3. Your Stone Pick stays yours; swap them in the Tool slot as you would the rod.
- Mole Claw now says "A mole claw, for a mole claw pick."
- Decisions: D-810.

## 0.3.255 (2026-11-10)
- New: the Fang Charm, the Bat Fang's first use. The workbench's GEAR tab makes it from 1 Bat Fang and 1 Copper Ore: a pale bat fang set in copper. Wear it, and each creature you beat gives you back 1 heart about 1 time in 4, never past your most. When it does, "The fang drinks. You feel better." shows and a small red heart rises beside the "+1" over you. A pile of bones scattered counts as beaten too.
- Bat Fang now says "A bat fang, for a fang charm."
- Decisions: D-809.
