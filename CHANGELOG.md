# Changelog

Newest first. Every PR adds exactly one entry, and that entry is the
version bump. The same lines go, word for word, into the in-game Version
history, `src/core/history-0.3.js` (D-254, D-528).

Versions:
- `0.0.x`: pre-production (decisions, docs, art studies). No playable game.
- `0.1.x`: foundation. The first code, built up one small visible step at a time.
- `0.2.x`: stage 0.2, from step 32: places with character, a dive worth
  repeating, and stronger, slowly (D-159).
- `0.3.x`: stage 0.3, the world (D-168), from 0.3.0, once stage 0.2's
  last steps were done (D-528).
- Later minor versions (`0.4`…) are set when the build plan in
  `docs/PROGRESS.md` defines the next stage.
- `1.0.0`: the first release the owner calls finished.

Entry format:

```
## 0.0.2 (2026-10-18)
- One line per change, written so the owner can follow it.
- Decisions: D-008. Questions closed: Q-001.
```

## 0.3.262 (2026-11-11)
- New: Quick Pour, the first upgrade in the Growth tree's second row, on Light, 1 ember, bought once, its tile a tipped flask with a drop falling. With it, pouring a flask from the bag takes no turn: no oil burns, no creature moves, and the game says "You pour a flask." A Pond Minnow's oil still takes a turn.
- The first time the second row opens, walking down past depth 8 or by a dev jump, the game says "Growth has a new row."
- Decisions: D-816.

## 0.3.261 (2026-11-11)
- The Growth tree's second row opens the first time you go deeper than depth 8. Until then, picking one of its locked tiles says "Reach depth 9 to open." Once open, each branch has a dashed tile to come, and the row above shows locked. A journey already past depth 8 finds it open.
- Decisions: D-815.

## 0.3.260 (2026-11-10)
- Planned: the Growth tree's second row. It will open the first time you go deeper than depth 8, and hold Quick Pour on Light (pouring a flask takes no turn), Guard on Body (about 1 bite in 6 glances off) and Thrift on Hands (making something keeps its cheapest part about 1 time in 4), each 1 ember. Nothing in the game changed yet.
- Decisions: D-814.
