# Changelog

Newest first. Every PR adds exactly one entry, and that entry is the
version bump. The same lines go, word for word, into the in-game Version
history, `src/core/history-0.3.js` (D-254, D-528).

Versions:
- `0.0.x`: pre-production (decisions, docs, art studies). No playable game.
- `0.1.x`: foundation. The first code, built up one small visible step at a time.
- `0.2.x`: stage 0.2, from step 32: places with character, a dive worth
  repeating, and stronger, slowly (D-159).
- `0.3.x`: stage 0.3, the world (D-168), from 0.3.0, once stage 0.2's
  last steps were done (D-528).
- Later minor versions (`0.4`…) are set when the build plan in
  `docs/PROGRESS.md` defines the next stage.
- `1.0.0`: the first release the owner calls finished.

Entry format:

```
## 0.0.2 (2026-10-18)
- One line per change, written so the owner can follow it.
- Decisions: D-008. Questions closed: Q-001.
```

## 0.3.267 (2026-11-11)
- Changed: Settings is in four tabs, CONTROLS, GAME, SCREEN and SOUND, at the top of its card where SETTINGS was, with the same lines as before: Controls holds Swipe, Tap, Arrow pad and Stop walking; Game the seed, the way to play (on a journey), Lantern and Flasks; Screen Motion, Attack marks and Stats line; Sound the Sound switch. Tap a tab, or press Tab for the next. Settings opens on the tab you last had open. On a narrow phone held upright, the tabs take two rows. VERSION HISTORY stays in the corner on every tab.
- Decisions: D-821. D-817 moved to the archive, word for word.

## 0.3.266 (2026-11-11)
- New: the bag has sounds, with Sound on. An item going into the bag makes a soft pat of cloth, never the same twice running; a weapon going from the bag into the hand is drawn like a knife; setting the workbench down knocks on wood. A fish caught keeps just its splash.
- Decisions: D-820. D-816 moved to the archive, word for word. Questions: Q-095 narrowed. The creatures' sounds moved to `docs/SOUNDS-2.md`, word for word.

## 0.3.265 (2026-11-11)
- New: the menus have sounds, with Sound on. Tapping a button on a card, or picking a line with Enter or Space, makes a soft tick when it changes something. A card opening turns a page, and closing it turns one back; a tap that opens or closes a card only turns the page. Picking something dim that can't be done makes a low wooden tock: the bag's Make or a recipe with too few parts, a dim line on the garden bed or campfire, a waystone not woken, and a Growth upgrade with too few embers.
- Decisions: D-819. D-815 moved to the archive, word for word. Questions: Q-095 narrowed.
