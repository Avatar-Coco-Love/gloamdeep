# Gloamdeep: notes for Claude Code

Gloamdeep is a grid-based, turn-based survival micro-RPG with action and
strategy. It is built phone-first and also plays on PC in any browser. You
carry a lantern down through dark places, and the oil runs low. Plain HTML,
CSS and JavaScript, with everything drawn and synthesized in code.

## The owner leads. Work in tiny steps.

- The owner wants to take part in every decision. The pace is a little
  faster than at kickoff (D-018).
- A PR may settle **several small decisions** together. Visible changes
  stay small: one small visible change per step ("the hero can move one
  tile"). Never bundle a new mechanic with a new system.
- **Propose before building.** Say what you found, offer 2 or 3 options with
  a recommendation (a quick mock-up or picture where it helps), and wait for
  the owner's choice. This applies to design, art, code structure and bug
  fixes.
- Never invent mechanics, story, names or numbers that are not in
  `docs/DECISIONS.md` or its archive files (`docs/archive/README.md`).
  If something is missing, add it to `docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md` and ask.
- Ask questions as **multiple choice** (the AskUserQuestion tool when it
  exists): 2 to 4 options, the recommended one first, more than one pick
  allowed when options can combine, and the owner can always add their own
  answer. Up to 4 related questions at a time.
- Write for the owner in plain words. Explain technical terms when they
  first come up.

## Start of every conversation

1. Pull the latest `main` first; the starting copy can be old (D-070).
   A start-up hook does this (D-092), silently. If it didn't run (Claude
   started one folder above the repo), `cd` in, fetch and check out
   `origin/main` by hand. If any PR is still open, ask the owner whether
   to merge it, update it or close it. If this conversation's
   branch had a PR merged, restart the branch from `origin/main`.
2. Read `docs/PROGRESS.md` on the fresh `main`. It says where things
   stand, what is "Next up" and what is waiting on the owner.
3. Read only the documents that the Next up item names.

## Where things live

Read the smallest file that answers the question.

| File | What it holds | When to read it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/PROGRESS.md` | status, Next up, the last 3 log entries | every conversation |
| `docs/DECISIONS.md` | the newest decisions; older ones archived | grep for an ID or topic |
| `docs/GLOSSARY.md` | the game's words and their decisions (D-264) | before naming anything |
| `docs/CONTENT.md` | every creature, find, tile and place (D-363); `SCOPE.md`, the plan (D-413) | before adding content |
| `docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md` | undecided questions, Q-001, Q-002… | when a step touches one |
| `docs/RESEARCH.md` | the owner's wish list, ideas kept; games and talks in `RESEARCH-GAMES.md` | when proposing a feature |
| `docs/DESIGN.md` | the one-page design brief | before proposing any feature |
| `docs/WORLD.md` | regions, ways between rooms, the map (D-170) | before any world, region or map step |
| `docs/regions/` | one rule sheet per region, once designed | only the region a step touches |
| `docs/VISION.md` | the pitch, inspirations, the pillars | when proposing a design |
| `docs/ART-DIRECTION.md` | the visual rules taken from the style study | before any drawing code |
| `docs/TECH.md` | architecture, code rules, adding content | before writing code |
| `docs/DEV-TOOLS.md` | the dev mode plan and tool list | when touching dev mode |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | versions, newest first | the top entry only |
| `docs/archive/` | old decisions (in force), changelog, log | grep only; its `README.md` is the index |
| `reference/style-study-1.html` | the approved look (545 lines, frozen) | art work only, by line range (see `reference/README.md`) |

## Keeping track: every PR does all of these

- **CHANGELOG.md**: add a new version entry at the top (the format is in its
  header). Each PR has exactly one version. Add the same lines, with a
  short title, at the top of `src/core/history-0.2.js`, the in-game
  Version history (D-254); `npm test` fails if the two differ.
- **docs/PROGRESS.md**: add a log entry, set "Next up" and update "Waiting
  on the owner". Keep only 3 log entries there. Move the oldest to the top
  of `docs/archive/PROGRESS-LOG.md`.
- **Name a PR by its version** (0.1.9) in the docs, never by its number,
  which isn't known until the PR exists (D-071). Docs-only PRs bump the
  version too (D-075).
- **"Waiting on the owner"** holds only questions and choices for the
  owner. Merging the open PR is always implied, so it is never listed
  (D-074).
- **Decisions**: when the owner settles something, add `D-xxx` to
  `docs/DECISIONS.md` with the date and the owner's choice in a sentence.
  If it answers a question, delete the `Q-xxx` entry from
  `docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md` and cite it in the decision ("answers Q-004").
  IDs are never reused or renumbered.
- **Decisions in the open PR** aren't final until it is merged. Playtest
  tweaks edit them in place, with a note of what changed ("changed after
  the playtest: 40 → 80 → 60 turns") (D-072).
- **Changing a merged decision**: never edit it silently. Add a new
  one ("supersedes D-005"), and mark the old one
  `Superseded by D-0xx (date)`. When `DECISIONS.md` passes 12 KB, move the
  superseded entries to `docs/archive/DECISIONS-SUPERSEDED.md`, and the
  rest of a finished stage to its own archive file (as D-041 did), and
  add the new file's line to `docs/archive/README.md`.
- Once code exists, the `VERSION` constant in the code must match the top
  `CHANGELOG.md` entry.

## Keeping context small

- No doc over 8 KB, except `docs/DECISIONS.md` (12 KB), `docs/PROGRESS.md`
  (4 KB) and the grep-only files in `docs/archive/`; `npm test` checks this
  (`tests/docs.test.js`, D-336). Archive or split when a doc gets close.
  Nothing is deleted. Old material moves to `docs/archive/`, and
  `CHANGELOG.md` keeps only its newest entries the same way.
- **An audit every 20 versions** (D-337): when the version in
  `docs/PROGRESS.md`'s "Next audit" line comes, the audit is Next up. It
  measures what a conversation reads at its start, archives, trims, and
  splits one big code file, nothing visible changed, then sets the next.
  Nothing useful is lost (D-338): moved text stays word for word, and the
  PR lists every line reworded or dropped (check with `git diff -U0`).
- Keep code files small. Mark sections with `// § name` so a file can be
  read by line range (`grep -n "§"`).
- Test output: one line per test or check, never full logs or page dumps.
- Diffs: run `git diff --stat` first.

## Git and PRs

- Never push to `main`. One PR per conversation. Merging is the owner's call.
- Fill in `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
- Every PR that changes something visible gets a private playtest Artifact
  (the owner can't play a PR before it is merged). Build it with
  `node tools/playtest.js <scratchpad>/playtest.html` (D-073), and
  put the link in the PR body and the `docs/PROGRESS.md` log entry.
  Republish to the same link after each push.
- A PR that adds or changes a sound also gets a sound board Artifact
  (`node tools/soundboard.js <scratchpad>/sounds.html`, D-256), linked
  and republished like the playtest, and in the chat.
- After every push, update the PR body so "What changed" and "Decisions"
  match the branch (D-076).
- End every conversation with a handoff of at most 5 lines: the PR link,
  what changed, what is waiting on the owner, and the proposed next step.

## Hard technical rules (details in `docs/TECH.md`)

- No external assets: no image, audio or font files, no CDNs, no frameworks,
  no build step (`tools/` is only for playtests). Visuals use Canvas 2D. Sound uses the Web Audio API.
- Phone first. Everything works with touch, mouse and keyboard.
- Game state is kept separate from drawing. All content (items, enemies,
  NPCs, tiles) lives in one data registry. Randomness goes through a seeded
  RNG. Dev tools are on for everyone (D-086); they work by editing the
  state and read from the registry (`docs/DEV-TOOLS.md`).
- Wrap every `localStorage` access in try/catch.
