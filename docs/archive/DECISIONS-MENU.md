# The main menu decisions (D-177 to D-193)

Moved unchanged from `docs/DECISIONS.md` at step 45 (D-196), when it
neared 12 KB: the main menu, steps 52 to 58, and the decision log's last
move (D-188). These are still in force unless marked superseded. Grep
for an ID or topic; never read this whole.

---

**D-177 · 2026-10-20 · A title screen and a pause menu** (owner's pick,
part of Q-044) The game opens on a title screen with its name and the
menu on it. During play a small pause menu offers Resume, Settings, How
to play and Back to title.

**D-178 · 2026-10-20 · The menu shows only what works** (owner's pick,
part of Q-044) A button appears only once its feature exists: Continue
with saving (step 37), Sound with sound. Nothing is shown greyed out.

**D-179 · 2026-10-20 · What Settings holds first** (owner's picks,
answers Q-025, part of Q-044) A Controls switch: tap and swipe, tap
only, or swipe only. A Motion switch: full or reduced, on top of the
device's own setting. A seed: random, or one typed in. How to play is
its own page of the controls for touch, mouse and keyboard.

**D-180 · 2026-10-20 · The menu comes after step 42** (owner's pick,
part of Q-044) The menu steps follow the starting region's design
(step 42), before the world steps from 43 on.

**D-181 · 2026-10-20 · The menu's look: the lantern in the dark**
(owner's pick, answers Q-044) Pitch black, the hero on crypt floor in
the lantern's dithered light, the name glowing warm above and a small
flame marking the chosen line. Drawn with the game's own tiles, sprites,
light and font, so it matches the game exactly, not the mock-up's
simplified copies. Picking themes, a changing or moving background and
a moving hero may come later.

**D-182 · 2026-10-20 · The starting region: 3 × 3, home in the centre**
(step 42, owner's picks, part of Q-036) The starting region is a 3 × 3
grid with all 9 cells used, every seed. The home base is in the centre
cell, every seed. Its name is still open (Q-045). Rule sheet:
`docs/regions/starting-region.md`.

**D-183 · 2026-10-20 · Mountains north, woods elsewhere** (step 42,
owner's pick, part of Q-036) The north row's 3 cells are mountain rooms;
the other 6 are woods, every seed.

**D-184 · 2026-10-20 · One cave, beside home; houses and ways out later**
(step 42, owner's picks, answers Q-036) One cave entrance for now, the
first cave's, in a side cell next to home (N, E, S or W from the seed),
with room for more caves later. No NPC houses yet, a slot kept for later.
Ways to other regions wait for the second region (Q-037).

**D-185 · 2026-10-20 · The first cave ends at 5 levels** (step 42,
owner's picks, answers Q-043) The first cave has a bottom: the 2 crypt
rooms and depths 3 to 5. The endless depths move behind a portal at the
bottom (D-019, D-032).
*Partly superseded by D-354 (2026-10-25): the cave goes on below depth 5
as built; where it ends, and its portal, wait for the portal step.*

**D-186 · 2026-10-20 · How the title screen is built** (step 52, owner's
picks) Drawn on the game's own canvas as a second screen, picked with
arrows, Enter, Space, a tap or a click. The name is the pixel font at
double size, carved: gold, a dark outline, an ember edge underneath
(changed after seeing 5 looks: glow → carved). The wrench and the
lantern button stay hidden until the journey starts.

**D-187 · 2026-10-20 · How the pause menu works** (step 53, owner's
picks) A pause button with two bars, in the lantern button's style,
sits just left of it (under it when the buttons stand beside the
picture); Esc or P open the menu too, and close it again. The menu is
drawn over the room behind a dark veil, its lines centred, picked like
the title's. No turn passes while it is open. Back to title ends the
journey: New journey then starts a new world with a new random seed.
*That last part superseded by D-239 (2026-10-22): Back to title keeps
the journey for Continue.*

**D-188 · 2026-10-20 · The decision log makes room again** (step 53,
as D-151) D-159 to D-167 (steps 31 to 33) moved unchanged to
`archive/DECISIONS-STAGE-0.2-1.md`. They stay in force.

**D-189 · 2026-10-20 · How Settings and the Controls switch work**
(step 54, owner's picks) Settings joins the title (New journey,
Settings) and the pause menu (Resume, Settings, Back to title). It is
a page headed Settings with a line "Controls: Tap and swipe" and Back;
picking the line moves it on to Tap only, Swipe only and round again,
and Left or Right change it too. Back, Esc or P return to the menu it
came from. The choice is kept on this device; if the browser's storage
is blocked it starts on Tap and swipe. It changes only walking in
play: Tap only stops swipes; Swipe only stops taps toward a side and
held fingers, though a tap on the hero still waits. Menus always take
both, so no one is locked out.

**D-190 · 2026-10-20 · How the Motion switch works** (step 55, owner's
picks) Settings gains a second line under Controls: "Motion: Full" or
"Motion: Reduced", above Back. Picking it, Left or Right flip it.
Until it is picked it follows the device's own reduced-motion setting
and shows what that setting is; once picked, the pick wins and is kept
on this device. Reduced stills the same things the device setting
always did: the walking slide, the shake, flames, flicker and fades.

**D-191 · 2026-10-20 · How the seed is set** (step 56, owner's picks)
Settings gains "Seed: Random" under Motion, above Back. Picking it opens
a seed pad drawn in the game's style: the digits typed so far, keys 1 to
9 and 0, Del, Random and OK; tapped, clicked, walked with the arrows, or
typed with a keyboard's digits and Backspace (the flame then moves to
OK, so Enter keeps it). Up to 5 digits, 1 to 99999 (D-150). OK keeps the
typed seed, or Random if none is typed; Esc or P leave it unchanged. A
typed seed starts every New journey until set back to Random, and is
kept on this device. A journey under way goes on as it is. From the
pause menu a Random line names this journey's seed: "Seed: Random (this
one 4071)".

**D-192 · 2026-10-20 · Every room changes with the seed** (step 57,
owner's picks) A standing rule: every room takes something from the
seed. Some are hand-made with seeded parts, others wholly generated.
The two crypt rooms (depths 1 and 2) stay hand-made in shape; the seed
places their flask and rat, as generated rooms do (D-149): the flask at
least 5 steps from the start, the rat at least 3 tiles from the start
and every stairs, and the second room's rat within 2 tiles of its flask
(D-138). A fall's new seed places them afresh (extends D-136, D-148).

**D-193 · 2026-10-20 · How to play** (step 58, owner's picks) One page
per way of playing: Touch, Mouse and Keyboard, headed How to play, the
page's name between two arrows, then Back. Left, Right, a tap on an
arrow or picking the name flip the page; it opens on the way last used
(touch until something is pressed). It lists Walk, Wait, Lantern and
Pause; how to hit a rat waits for a bestiary (Q-047). Walking by touch
or mouse follows the Controls switch, so only what works is shown
(D-178, D-189). On the title it sits under New journey; on the pause
menu after Settings (D-177). Back, Esc or P return to the menu.
