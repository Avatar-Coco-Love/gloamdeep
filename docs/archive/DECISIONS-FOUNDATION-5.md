# Foundation decisions, part 5 (D-114 to D-129)

Moved unchanged from `docs/DECISIONS.md` at step 28 (D-151), when it neared
12 KB: steps 22 to 24 (the rat fights back, an unlit torch, the rat moves).
These are still in force unless marked superseded. Grep for an ID or
topic; never read this whole.

## Steps 22 to 24

**D-114 · 2026-10-18 · The rat bites** (step 22, supersedes the last
sentence of D-109, answers Q-030) After each passed turn (a step, a
wait or a hit), every enemy next to the hero, four ways, bites. ~~The rat
stays on its tile; moving and fleeing come later.~~ *Superseded by D-128
(2026-10-18): a rat now walks; fleeing comes later.* It bites with the
lantern off too, for now. A rat killed by the hit doesn't bite.

**D-115 · 2026-10-18 · The hero's health** (step 22, answers Q-030) The
hero has 5 health, and a rat's bite takes 1. Two rats next to the hero
bite twice.

**D-116 · 2026-10-18 · Hearts** (step 22, answers Q-030) Health shows
as 5 small pixel hearts in the top left of the room, in a box like the
oil bar's. A full heart is the hostile red; an empty one goes dark, like
an empty oil segment.

**D-117 · 2026-10-18 · The bite line** (step 22) "The rat bites you."
It replaces any other line said on the same turn, the hit line and the
oil lines too (so a hit the rat survives now shows the bite). The
hearts and oil bar still show the rest.

**D-118 · 2026-10-18 · How a bite looks** (step 22) The hero flashes the
hostile red for 0.14 s and the room shakes a pixel for 0.12 s (none with
reduced motion), as a hit does.

**D-119 · 2026-10-18 · Falling** *Partly superseded by D-332 (2026-10-25): the room stays as it was.* (step 22, answers Q-030, a stand-in for
D-020 until a home base exists) At 0 health the hero falls and wakes on
the room's starting tile, at once, with no slide. The room is as it
began (the starting rat back, spawned things gone), health is full and
the oil is back to its start (75%). The remembered map stays (D-021).
The turn still counts. The line is "You fall, and wake again."

**D-120 · 2026-10-18 · The decision log makes room again** (step 22, as
D-103) D-077 to D-093 (steps 15 to 17 and the 0.1.13 dev tools) moved
unchanged to `archive/DECISIONS-FOUNDATION-3.md`. They stay in force.
D-105 moved to `archive/DECISIONS-SUPERSEDED.md`.

**D-121 · 2026-10-18 · Lighting an unlit torch** (step 23, D-015) The
hero lights an unlit torch by walking into its wall from the tile it
faces: below a face torch, beside a side one. It stays lit for good.
In the registry it is its own light, "Unlit torch", with no light, which
becomes a torch when lit.

**D-122 · 2026-10-18 · What lighting costs** (step 23) It passes a turn
like a step or a hit, so the lantern burns its usual oil and a rat next
to the hero bites; no extra oil. It needs the lantern lit: off, nothing
lights and no turn passes.

**D-123 · 2026-10-18 · The first room's unlit torch** (step 23) A fourth
torch, unlit, on the face of the small block at 7,9, two tiles from the
start. A fall (D-119) and "Reset room" put it back unlit, like the rat.
The spawn tool's Lights group has "Unlit torch", with the torch's rules
for where it can sit (D-100).

**D-124 · 2026-10-18 · The torch lines** (step 23) Lighting says "You
light the torch."; an oil line or a bite on the same turn replaces it,
as for a hit (D-112, D-117). Walking into it with the lantern off says
"Your lantern is dark." and the hero bumps as at a wall.

**D-125 · 2026-10-18 · How an unlit torch looks** (step 23, owner
picked option A from the picture) The torch's bracket with a charred
stub where the flame would be, and one grey ash pixel. It is still and
gives no light, so it shows only in other light and in memory, like the
wall.

**D-126 · 2026-10-18 · The rat notices the hero in light** (step 24, D-026,
owner's pick) A rat notices the hero when it stands on a tile lit by
the lantern or a burning torch: if the hero can see it, it sees them
(D-106). Lit counts as for memory: the light reaches the tile's centre,
inside 95% of its reach (D-059). With the lantern off, a rat in the dark
doesn't notice them; one in torchlight still does. *Partly superseded by
D-157 (2026-10-19): a bite or a hit it lives through makes it notice, even
in the dark.* *Partly superseded by D-226 (2026-10-21): it must also
have a clear line to the hero, no wall between.*

**D-127 · 2026-10-18 · Once noticed, it keeps coming** (step 24, owner's pick)
A rat that has noticed the hero keeps chasing until it dies or the hero
falls (D-119 puts it back as it began), lantern off or not. *Partly
superseded by D-292 (2026-10-24): once hurt, a rat flees instead.*

**D-128 · 2026-10-18 · How the rat walks** (step 24, owner's pick,
supersedes part of D-114) After each
passed turn, a chasing rat not next to the hero steps one tile toward
them, along the farther side first (as a held finger does, D-044). If a
wall, an item, another enemy or the hero is in the way it tries the
other side toward them, and else stays put. No going around walls.
Rats move in list order, so one waits behind another. It slides to its
new tile like the hero (D-043), at once with reduced motion.

**D-129 · 2026-10-18 · Stepping in, then biting** (step 24, owner's pick, D-016)
Rats already next to the hero bite (D-114); a rat that steps next to
them this turn bites only on the next one, so the hero has a turn to
swing first.
