# Foundation decisions, part 4 (D-094 to D-113)

Moved unchanged from `docs/DECISIONS.md` at step 25 (D-137), when it neared
12 KB: steps 18 to 21 (the text line, torches, the rat, fighting it).
These are still in force unless marked superseded. Grep for an ID or
topic; never read this whole.

## Steps 18 to 21

**D-094 · 2026-10-18 · The text line** (step 18, answers Q-028)
Game text shows on one line in a strip under the room, so no tile is
ever covered; the picture grows to 176 × 221. The letters are the pixel
font (D-031), 7 pixels tall with 2 below for g, j, p, q, y, centred.

**D-095 · 2026-10-18 · How long a line stays** (step 18)
A line stays 5 turns (steps or waits), then fades in about half a
second; with reduced motion it just goes. A new line replaces it at
once.

**D-096 · 2026-10-18 · The oil lines** (step 18, answers Q-028)
"The flame is getting low." as the oil drops under 20%, and "The
lantern gutters to an ember." as it runs dry (style study 1's words).
Each is said once, as the oil crosses its mark on the way down, and
again only after the oil has gone back above it. A flask found on the
same step counts first.

**D-097 · 2026-10-18 · Text colours** (step 18)
Ordinary lines use the study's muted grey (`#9790a4`); warnings, like
the lantern guttering, use the oil bar's amber (`#ffc65c`).

**D-098 · 2026-10-18 · Torches, the first light kind** (step 19, D-024)
Light sources are their own kind in the registry, with their own list in
the game state, like items. A light sits on a tile; the registry gives
its colour, reach and flicker. The torch is the study's: orange (1.2,
0.78, 0.42), a reach of 3 tiles, flickering about ±9%. Other light
sources (braziers, glowing life…) join this list in later steps.

**D-099 · 2026-10-18 · A torch picks its look from where it sits** (step 19)
On a wall with its brick face showing, it hangs on the face as in the
study. Otherwise it goes on a wall side that has open ground next to it:
a short iron arm out from the wall's edge, the same flame on top (owner
approved the picture). The order is fixed: face, then left, then right.
Other mounts (on the floor, standing) come later.

**D-100 · 2026-10-18 · No torch where it can't sit** (step 19)
The dev spawn tool places no torch on floor, inside solid wall, or on a
tile that already has a light, as a wall can't go on the hero (D-049).

**D-101 · 2026-10-18 · The first room's torches, and what they show**
(step 19) The study's three: the top wall at 2,0 and the middle block at
4,4, and the top-right one moved from 8,0 to 7,0 so the oil bar doesn't
cover it. Their light shows wherever it falls, also with the lantern
off; only the lantern adds tiles to memory (D-059). The full study look:
bracket, a 3-frame swaying flame and rising embers, always bright;
"reduce motion" stops the sway, flicker and embers. The room keeps its
darkness values (D-063).

**D-102 · 2026-10-18 · Tile edits around a torch** (step 19)
When a dev spawn changes the tiles around a torch, it picks its look
again (D-099). A change that would leave it nowhere to sit, a floor on
its own wall included, is refused. "Reset room" brings the starting
torches back and removes spawned ones.

**D-103 · 2026-10-18 · The decision log makes room again** (step 19, as
D-083) D-053 to D-069 (steps 12 to 14) moved unchanged to
`archive/DECISIONS-FOUNDATION-2.md`. They stay in force.

**D-104 · 2026-10-18 · The rat, the first enemy** (step 20, D-009)
Enemies are their own kind in the registry, with their own list in the
game state, like items and lights. The rat is redrawn from the study's
(option A, owner approved the picture): side on, ~~facing right~~
*(superseded by D-158, 2026-10-19: it faces the way it walks)*, grey with
a pink hostile eye, ear, nose, feet and tail, and a shaded belly. ~~It
bobs a pixel about every half second, as the study's did (0.52 s), still
with reduced motion.~~ *(superseded by D-563, 2026-11-02: no creature bobs)*

**D-106 · 2026-10-18 · The rat is seen only in light** (step 20)
Lantern or torch light shows the rat, shaded like the floor around it.
~~Memory never does: on a remembered tile out of the light, the floor
shows without it, and with the lantern off and no torch near it can't
be seen at all.~~ *Superseded by D-153 (2026-10-18): a rat on a
remembered tile shows in its dim light, like the flask.* The first
room's rat sits where the study's did, at 2,10.

**D-107 · 2026-10-18 · The rat's line** (step 20)
"The rat squeaks and holds its ground." The study's line began "You
swing your lantern.", but the whole of it doesn't fit the text line, so
it was cut to fit (owner's pick). *Partly superseded by D-292
(2026-10-24): a rat the hit hurts says "The rat squeaks and flees."*

**D-108 · 2026-10-18 · Spawning enemies** (step 20)
The spawn tool has an Enemies group. An enemy goes on floor, off the
hero, one thing per tile: not on an item or another enemy, and no wall
or item goes on it. "Reset room" brings the starting rat back and
removes spawned ones.

**D-109 · 2026-10-18 · Swinging the lantern** (step 21, supersedes
D-105, answers part of Q-030) Walking into an enemy swings the lantern
at it, the hero's weapon until they find one (D-027); the hero stays
put. It flashes white for 0.14 s and the room shakes a pixel for
0.12 s (none with reduced motion), as before. ~~The rat doesn't fight
back yet.~~ *That last sentence is superseded by D-114 (2026-10-18).*

**D-110 · 2026-10-18 · The rat's health** (step 21, answers part of
Q-030) A rat has 2 health and a lantern hit takes 1, so two hits kill
it. Each rat keeps its own health.

**D-111 · 2026-10-18 · An attack passes a turn** (step 21, answers
part of Q-030) Like a step: the turn counts and oil burns while the
lantern is lit.

**D-112 · 2026-10-18 · The rat's lines** (step 21) A hit it survives
says D-107's line; the kill says "The rat squeaks and falls still."
An oil line crossed on the same turn replaces either, as after a step.

**D-113 · 2026-10-18 · How the rat dies** (step 21) The killing hit
flashes and shakes like any hit, then the rat is gone, leaving nothing
behind.
