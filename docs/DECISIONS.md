# Decisions

Every settled decision, oldest first. IDs are permanent. To change a
decision, add a new one that supersedes it and mark the old one (see
`PR-CHECKLIST.md`, "Keeping track"). Superseded entries move to
`archive/DECISIONS-SUPERSEDED.md` once this file passes 12 KB.
Older decisions are archived but still in force: `archive/README.md`
says which file holds which IDs; grep there for an ID or topic.

Format: `D-xxx · date · title`, then the decision and, where useful, why.

**D-338 · 2026-10-25 · Audits lose nothing** (the owner's wish) Nothing
important, useful, educational or insightful is lost in a cleanup. Text is
moved word for word, never cut; only pointers, indexes and rules may be
reworded. Each audit compares every removed line with the whole repo and
lists, in its PR, each line not found word for word, with why.

**D-363 · 2026-10-25 · A content index and an adding checklist** (the
owner's picks, both recommended) `docs/CONTENT.md` lists every creature,
find, tile, light and place with its numbers, where it turns up and its
decisions, so proposals build on what exists. `TECH.md`'s "Adding content"
lists the files each kind of content touches. A PR that adds or changes
content updates both.

**D-431 · 2026-10-29 · How we work: one step a conversation** (the owner's
pick, recommended) The owner keeps choosing every question. Each
conversation does one step, ends with its handoff, and the next step
starts in a fresh conversation, so less is read again each time.

**D-518 · 2026-10-31 · An audit every 40 versions** (the owner's pick,
recommended; supersedes D-337's 20) The owner asked if audits help. The
start-of-conversation read stays near 11.5 KB (17 KB before the first),
but the size test already makes normal steps trim, and code splits are
outgrown in an audit or two, while 20 versions is about a day. So an
audit comes every 40 versions; the size test still guards in between.

**D-732 · 2026-11-09 · A playbook of how we work** (the owner's picks,
all recommended) The owner wants this project's way of working kept for
future projects. `docs/WORKFLOW.md` gathers it in one place: the steps
of a step, each habit and why, what changed along the way, and how to
start a new project. Each audit adds what that stretch taught us about
working together. Built now as its own step, nothing visible changed.

**D-733 · 2026-11-09 · A bigger surface, the plan** (the owner's picks,
all recommended but where a fall wakes; builds D-182 to D-184, answers
Q-081) The surface grows to Hearthwood's 3 × 3 rooms, mountains in the
north row, woods elsewhere, home in the centre (D-182, D-183). A new
journey no longer begins in the crypt nor at home or the cave: the seed
picks one of the south woods rooms, never the cave's, and the hero walks
north to find the waystone. A fall wakes the hero (the owner's own
answer): in the last bed slept in; with none, at the home waystone once
woken; otherwise in the room where the journey began. The rooms differ:
mountain rooms, and woods from thick to open glades, the seed picking.
The order, one step each: 1 the 9 rooms, all woods, walking off an edge
into the next; home stays today's woods room, so what was set down keeps
its place, and the cave mouth moves to a room beside home (D-184); 2 the
south start, its teaching goal's words with it; 3 waking after a fall
(supersedes D-119's crypt when built); 4 mountain rooms; 5 thick woods
and open glades. Nothing is built yet. D-712 and D-713 move to
`archive/DECISIONS-GOALS.md`, word for word.

**D-738 · 2026-11-09 · Mountain rooms** (the owner's picks, all
recommended but the rock's look; builds D-733's step 4) Hearthwood's
north row, every seed, is mountain rooms: rocky slopes, the woods' grass
with rock where the trees would stand and a few lone trees inside. Each
holds 3 grey boulders, as a Cave room does (D-282), and the woods' 3
sticks and fallen branch; no pond or bush. The three are made the same
way, only the seed differing. The next step, the owner's own picks:
outside rock drawn rounded, as cave walls are, and rock going on past a
mountain room's edges; till then it is drawn as the mouth's rocks.
Claude's calls the owner may change: a tree 2 or more tiles in from the
edge stays a tree 1 time in 4; a room grows as a woods room, its paths
cut, then its trees made rock, so the paths stay where they were; a
mountain room already visited in an older save stays woods; on the map,
rock and boulders on the surface show in the cave rock's grey.

**D-739 · 2026-11-09 · Rounded rock** (the owner's picks, all
recommended; builds D-738's next step, added to D-733's plan before its
step 5) The surface's rock,
in the mountain rooms and by the cave mouth, is drawn rounded, as the cave
walls are, but lit by day: a sunlit grey top, not the cave's near-black,
and fuller, so a lone rock stays a lump, not a chip. Trees stand in front
of the rock. Past a mountain room's edge the rock goes on, but for a
grass passage straight out from each way on. The cave mouth's rocks are
only rounded; the mouth's own look waits for its step. Next, the owner's
picks: after the audit, a new cave mouth, one of a few looks the seed
picks, shown first as mock-ups (rock arch in a mound, an overgrown mouth,
a hole in the ground, a fallen-stone doorway); the outside art polished
in steps of its own. Claude's calls the owner may change: a room's rock
goes on past its edge when its edge holds rock and no tree or stump, so
a mountain room an older save keeps as woods keeps its trees there; the
code is `src/render/outcrop.js`.

**D-740 · 2026-11-09 · The twelfth audit** (the owner's picks, all
recommended) At 0.3.192, nothing visible changed. A conversation's start
reads 10.2 KB, not 10.5. The in-game history's stage 0.3 file is split
again word for word: 0.3.76 to 0.3.150 go to `src/core/history-0.3-2.js`
(60 KB to 22 and 39). D-699 moves to `archive/DECISIONS-AUDITS.md`, and
D-734 to D-737, built, to `archive/DECISIONS-SURFACE.md`; ticked steps
21 and 22 are archived; all word for word. The start-up hook's message
names the commit checked out, not the old local `main` a shallow cloud
copy keeps. `WORKFLOW.md` gains what this stretch taught. One bug hunt
read the code since 0.3.152; its findings are listed for the owner to
pick from (https://claude.ai/artifact/NYbJtLXs97xmn7s1YBV4kK), each fix its own small step with a test.
The next audit is at 0.3.232.

**D-741 · 2026-11-09 · The playbook caught up, and kept up** (the owner's
picks, all recommended; builds D-732) The owner asked that the playbook
hold everything done so far and grow as we go. Four parts are added:
how the game grew (stages, a playtest setting each plan, groundwork
first, only what works shows), our tools, lessons from bugs and design
habits. They go in a new `docs/WORKFLOW-2.md`, so `WORKFLOW.md` stays
under its cap. When a step teaches something about working together,
its PR adds one line to `WORKFLOW.md`'s "Since the last audit"
(`PR-CHECKLIST.md` reminds), and each audit moves the lines into place.
Nothing visible changed.

**D-742 · 2026-11-09 · The bug hunt's fixes** (the owner's picks, all
recommended; the owner asked that every known bug be fixed, in one PR;
answers D-740's list) All nine findings are fixed, each with a test.
B1: cutting a path between Hearthwood rooms clears a fallen branch or
berry bush in its way, as a tree. B2, B3: one save upgrade (20 → 21)
makes each north room never seen, with nothing taken, today's mountain
room, cuts every Hearthwood room's paths again, and brings the copies a
fall and the dev Reset read up the same way, home's without the old
mouth. B6: a goal the journey's start skips, waiting in an older
profile, is ticked quietly, unpaid, and not listed. Claude's calls the
owner may change: B4, goals done on one turn each roll their reward
with the goal mixed in; B5 and T1, the unguarded flask and the rat
pack roll with salts of their own, so unvisited rooms may change; T2, a
spit grub's glob flies over a pile of bones; T3, a scorpion's tail
raised as the hero left is lowered when they come back (a fall that
wakes in the same room still keeps it).

**D-743 · 2026-11-09 · Words that fit** (the owner's picks, all
recommended; the owner asked that words running past a card's edge,
upright and elsewhere, be found and fixed, ready for what is added
later) Every card was drawn at upright and sideways phone sizes with
all content; six places failed. A quest's how wraps, and a done goal's
reward goes on its own grey line under it where it doesn't fit beside
the goal. A Journal list taller than its card (Records, the Bestiary,
a creature's page, Feats, Quests) scrolls a row at a time by a swipe,
the wheel or Up and Down, a page by Page Up and Down, with the thin bar
Version history has; upright the Bestiary is one table, sideways two
scroll together. The goal line's words wrap so it ends left of the
round map. A test draws every card at those sizes with every item,
creature, goal and boon, and fails when words leave a card or overlap.
Claude's calls the owner may change: in the stash chest, a long name
level with STORE wraps short of it, and the grey hint is left out where
it would pass the card's foot; Up and Down on the Bestiary's table
still pick a row, kept in view.

**D-744 · 2026-11-09 · A craggy cave mouth** (the owner's picks; builds
D-739's step 24; mock-ups at https://claude.ai/artifact/MdF3oCUuabfT9v4EBbv2HS)
Of round 1's four looks the owner turned down the hole in the ground
(unless falling down holes ever comes, Q-089) and the grassy mound, which
didn't look good and hardly read as a cave. Of round 2's five, darker and
plainer, the owner picked the craggy cave and the overgrown mouth. The
seed picks the mouth's look (mouthOf), today's small arch kept as a third.
One look a step, each with its side and bottom edge mock-up first. First
the craggy cave: on the top edge a wide, rough mouth in the rock, black
inside, rock teeth hanging from its top; on another edge the rock roofs
over the outer part of the tile, joining the rocks either side, and the
ground dives black under it. Walking is unchanged. Claude's calls the
owner may change: the looks are listed in the registry (`caveMouth`'s
`looks`) and picked from their own seed stream, so each world's mouth
stays where it was; a few pebbles lie at the rocks' feet, clear of the
tile in front; the craggy cave has no worn path in front, as mocked.
