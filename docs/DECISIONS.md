# Decisions

Every settled decision, oldest first. IDs are permanent. To change a
decision, add a new one that supersedes it and mark the old one (see
`PR-CHECKLIST.md`, "Keeping track"). Superseded entries move to
`archive/DECISIONS-SUPERSEDED.md` once this file passes 12 KB.
Older decisions are archived but still in force: `archive/README.md`
says which file holds which IDs; grep there for an ID or topic.

Format: `D-xxx · date · title`, then the decision and, where useful, why.

**D-338 · 2026-10-25 · Audits lose nothing** (the owner's wish) Nothing
important, useful, educational or insightful is lost in a cleanup. Text is
moved word for word, never cut; only pointers, indexes and rules may be
reworded. Each audit compares every removed line with the whole repo and
lists, in its PR, each line not found word for word, with why.

**D-363 · 2026-10-25 · A content index and an adding checklist** (the
owner's picks, both recommended) `docs/CONTENT.md` lists every creature,
find, tile, light and place with its numbers, where it turns up and its
decisions, so proposals build on what exists. `TECH.md`'s "Adding content"
lists the files each kind of content touches. A PR that adds or changes
content updates both.

**D-431 · 2026-10-29 · How we work: one step a conversation** (the owner's
pick, recommended) The owner keeps choosing every question. Each
conversation does one step, ends with its handoff, and the next step
starts in a fresh conversation, so less is read again each time.

**D-518 · 2026-10-31 · An audit every 40 versions** (the owner's pick,
recommended; supersedes D-337's 20) The owner asked if audits help. The
start-of-conversation read stays near 11.5 KB (17 KB before the first),
but the size test already makes normal steps trim, and code splits are
outgrown in an audit or two, while 20 versions is about a day. So an
audit comes every 40 versions; the size test still guards in between.

**D-732 · 2026-11-09 · A playbook of how we work** (the owner's picks,
all recommended) The owner wants this project's way of working kept for
future projects. `docs/WORKFLOW.md` gathers it in one place: the steps
of a step, each habit and why, what changed along the way, and how to
start a new project. Each audit adds what that stretch taught us about
working together. Built now as its own step, nothing visible changed.

**D-741 · 2026-11-09 · The playbook caught up, and kept up** (the owner's
picks, all recommended; builds D-732) The owner asked that the playbook
hold everything done so far and grow as we go. Four parts are added:
how the game grew (stages, a playtest setting each plan, groundwork
first, only what works shows), our tools, lessons from bugs and design
habits. They go in a new `docs/WORKFLOW-2.md`, so `WORKFLOW.md` stays
under its cap. When a step teaches something about working together,
its PR adds one line to `WORKFLOW.md`'s "Since the last audit"
(`PR-CHECKLIST.md` reminds), and each audit moves the lines into place.
Nothing visible changed.

**D-790 · 2026-11-10 · Copyable next prompts** (the owner's request)
Each PR's handoff ends, before merging, with a few short prompts the
owner can copy to pick the next direction, one per choice, or a single
one when there is only one way on (`PR-CHECKLIST.md`). When they are
given changed by D-795 (2026-11-10): once, after the merge.

**D-799 · 2026-11-10 · The finds plan** (the owner's picks, all
recommended, from a plan page: https://claude.ai/artifact/GnPo6RnybF7g6ogTdiET6y;
narrows Q-061 and Q-093) Each find kept for crafts later gets one first
use, with more uses free to come later: Crab Shell, the Shell Vest
(D-801); Grub Skin, a Spitproof Draught; Bunny Fur, a Fur Bedroll for
sleeping out; Bat Wing, an Echo Charm showing creatures in the dark
near by; Lurker Claw, a Shade Draught, creatures noticing the hero only
near; Rat Bone, a Bone Hook for the rod; Glow Gland, a Glow Lamp, a
longer torch; Bat Fang, a Fang Charm, a heart back now and then from a
beaten creature; Mole Claw, the Mole Claw Pick. With later steps: Oil
Bladder, the lantern's first tank; Gloam Eye, its first glass, showing
creatures in disguise; Stinger, a Stinger Spear poisoning creatures;
Venom Sac, a Venom Oil for weapons. Kept for later too: Bunny Fur, a
warm lining; Bat Wing, arrows' fletching; Stinger, arrowheads; Rat Bone,
a Bone Club; claw weapons. They are built one a step, in that order,
each one's numbers settled at its step (the plan's are drafts). The
owner's wish for weapons (Q-094): a switch to show creatures' coming
attacks and one to show the hero's. Others offered: two or three a PR;
a waterskin, a Bat Wing torch, a Sting Salve, Bone Meal, a Tick Charm,
an Eye Charm, a Wayglow, a Mole Charm, a long Ward.
