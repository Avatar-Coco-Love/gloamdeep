# Decisions

Every settled decision, oldest first. IDs are permanent. To change a
decision, add a new one that supersedes it and mark the old one (see
`CLAUDE.md`, "Keeping track"). Superseded entries move to
`archive/DECISIONS-SUPERSEDED.md` once this file passes 12 KB.
Older decisions are archived but still in force: `archive/README.md`
says which file holds which IDs; grep there for an ID or topic.

Format: `D-xxx · date · title`, then the decision and, where useful, why.

**D-168 · 2026-10-19 · Stage 0.3: the world, next** (owner's pick) The
world, made of regions, comes next as stage 0.3, starting with the
starting region. Stage 0.2's steps not yet built (34 to 41) wait and are
slotted in later. ~~Steps of stage 0.3 are versioned 0.3.x.~~ *That part
superseded by D-237 (2026-10-22): versions stay 0.2.x.* The step list
is in `PROGRESS.md` and may change as we go.

**D-169 · 2026-10-19 · Regions are grids of rooms** (the owner's idea)
The world, surface and below, is split into regions joined to each
other. Each region is a grid of cells (a 3 × 3 marsh has 9), and not
every cell must be used. Each region has its own rule sheet for how it
generates, including promises that hold for every seed: a special room
with its own rules, a single secret entrance to it from a side that
changes with the seed, or a special item that must appear in a named
room or building. Each cave follows its own rules too. Generated once
per save, as D-019.

**D-170 · 2026-10-19 · Where the world is written down** (owner's pick)
`docs/WORLD.md` holds how the world works, under 8 KB. Each region gets
its own rule sheet in `docs/regions/`, one file per region, made when the
region is designed. Undecided details are open questions.

**D-171 · 2026-10-19 · Ways between rooms** (the owner's idea) Rooms
join by stairs up and down, by openings at their sides into the room
beside them, by water for a hero who can swim (Q-039), and by secret
entrances. Both sides of a way line up exactly, and each room is made to
fit the ways into it.

**D-172 · 2026-10-19 · Rooms of every shape and size** (the owner's idea
and pick) Rooms differ in shape and size by their kind: tunnels are
narrow, deserts are vast. A room bigger than the screen scrolls, with the
camera following the hero. The kinds and sizes are Q-038.

**D-173 · 2026-10-19 · Light comes through openings** (the owner's idea)
A doorway, cave mouth or stairs lets in the light of the place beyond.
Daylight shines in behind you by day, less in rain or snow, not at
night, following the time of day (D-025) and the weather (Q-035). An
open way into a lit room not yet found glows, so you can tell a lit
space lies ahead. Details are Q-040.

**D-174 · 2026-10-19 · Stairs must be found** (the owner's idea,
supersedes part of D-134) The stairs' glow is dimmer and shows only where
the fog of war has lifted, so stairs and doors must be found, unless
other light reveals them. Some underground places are brightly lit.
How dim is Q-041.

**D-175 · 2026-10-19 · Today's game becomes the first cave** (owner's
pick) The two crypt rooms and the generated depths below them become the
first cave under the starting region, reached from a cave entrance on
the surface. Q-043 asks whether it gets a bottom.

**D-176 · 2026-10-19 · A world map to uncover** (the owner's idea,
builds on D-021) Players uncover the map as they explore. Dev tools get
a switch that reveals the whole map, and a map mode, which may be the
same map players see. Details are Q-042.

**D-336 · 2026-10-25 · The first regular audit** (the owner's picks, all
recommended) A conversation given to tidying, with nothing visible changed:
`CLAUDE.md` loses its list of archive files, now one index in
`archive/README.md`; `PROGRESS.md`'s ticked build steps move to the
progress archive; `CHANGELOG.md` keeps its newest entries, the rest in
`archive/CHANGELOG-STAGE-0.2-1.md`; and `tests/docs.test.js` fails when a
doc passes its cap (8 KB; `DECISIONS.md` 12 KB; `PROGRESS.md` 4 KB, as before) or
the archive index misses a file. The 0.2.1 setup script line is in place.

**D-337 · 2026-10-25 · An audit every 20 versions** (the owner's picks, both
recommended) `PROGRESS.md` names the next audit's version; when it comes,
the audit is Next up. Each audit also splits one big code file into
smaller ones, nothing visible changed (order may change: `history-0.2.js`,
`screens.js`, `turn.js`, `main.js`). The next audit is at 0.2.129.
*Partly superseded by D-362 (2026-10-25): that audit came at 0.2.123, and
the next is at 0.2.143.*

**D-338 · 2026-10-25 · Audits lose nothing** (the owner's wish) Nothing
important, useful, educational or insightful is lost in a cleanup. Text is
moved word for word, never cut; only pointers, indexes and rules may be
reworded. Each audit compares every removed line with the whole repo and
lists, in its PR, each line not found word for word, with why.

**D-362 · 2026-10-25 · The second audit, early, turn.js split first** (the
owner's picks, recommended; supersedes D-337's 0.2.129) The audit comes now, at 0.2.123,
seven versions early, so things can go on being added cleanly and quickly;
the next is at 0.2.143. Its split is `turn.js`, before the other big files:
into `state.js`, `endturn.js`, `creatureturn.js`, `fall.js` and
`bagturn.js`, with `turn.js` passing their rules on, so the rest of the
game imports from it as before (the playtest packer learns that form).
`history-0.2.js`, `screens.js` and `main.js` follow at later audits. The
finished decisions D-332 to D-361 (but D-336 to D-338) moved unchanged to
`archive/DECISIONS-GROWING-7.md` and `archive/DECISIONS-CREATURES.md`.

**D-363 · 2026-10-25 · A content index and an adding checklist** (the
owner's picks, both recommended) `docs/CONTENT.md` lists every creature,
find, tile, light and place with its numbers, where it turns up and its
decisions, so proposals build on what exists. `TECH.md`'s "Adding content"
lists the files each kind of content touches. A PR that adds or changes
content updates both.

**D-392 · 2026-10-28 · The third audit: history-0.2.js split** (the
owner's picks, all recommended) The audit at 0.2.143 splits
`history-0.2.js` by version: new versions stay at its top, 0.2.60 to
0.2.119 move to `history-0.2-2.js` and 0.2.0 to 0.2.59 to
`history-0.2-1.js`, word for word, the Version history unchanged.
D-378 to D-380 and D-385 to D-391, the corner HUD and the menu cards, all
built, moved unchanged to `archive/DECISIONS-CARDS.md`. `CHANGELOG.md`
keeps its newest 3 entries. `CLAUDE.md`'s pointers are tidied, its rules
word for word. `screens.js` and `main.js` follow at later audits; the next
is at 0.2.163.

**D-421 · 2026-10-28 · The fourth audit, tiny** (the owner's picks, both
recommended) The audit at 0.2.164 is kept small: the profile screens
(name pad, cloak, eyes, trim, clothes, Rename and Look) move word for word
from `screens.js` into `profilescreens.js`, nothing visible changed;
`CHANGELOG.md` keeps its newest 3 entries; `CLAUDE.md`'s file table is
tidied, its rules word for word. The rest of `screens.js` and `main.js`
follow at later audits; the next is at 0.2.184.

**D-431 · 2026-10-29 · How we work: one step a conversation** (the owner's
pick, recommended) The owner keeps choosing every question. Each
conversation does one step, ends with its handoff, and the next step
starts in a fresh conversation, so less is read again each time.

**D-468 · 2026-10-30 · The fifth audit: the world screens** (the
owner's picks, all recommended but the glossary split) The audit
at 0.2.186 moves the Seed Explorer, Settings' ways to play and the seed
pad word for word from `screens.js` into `explorerscreens.js`, nothing
visible changed. D-449 moves unchanged to `archive/DECISIONS-STEERING.md`
and D-461 to D-467 to `archive/DECISIONS-SCOPE-2.md`; `CHANGELOG.md`
keeps its newest 3 entries; `CLAUDE.md`'s pointers are tidied, its rules
word for word; `GLOSSARY.md`'s "In the code" moves word for word to
`GLOSSARY-CODE.md`. The rest of `screens.js` and `main.js` follow at
later audits; the next is at 0.2.206.

**D-473 · 2026-10-30 · The scope's build order** (the owner's picks,
all recommended; answers the Next up of 0.2.187) Drops come first, so
the five creatures of today reward the hero and the loop deeper → find
→ craft → deeper closes soonest. The first 8 steps, each one small
visible change, with names and numbers asked at each one's own step:
a beaten rat leaves a Rat Tail (D-453, D-454); the other four common
drops; the rare drops; a first recipe using a creature material;
torches made and set down (D-459); a second weapon kind and the swap
(D-457); a pick and the first ore (D-450); the Growth tree, today's
hearts in Body (D-462). The rest follows later, in an order asked
then. The plan lists only those 8 in `PROGRESS.md`. Half and Automatic
(Q-069) stay waiting, outside the order.

**D-482 · 2026-10-30 · The rest of the build order** (the owner's picks,
all recommended; answers the Next up of 0.2.196) Lantern parts come
next: Copper Ore, mined since step 7, gets its first use, and the
lantern is the heart of the game. Claude proposes the rest of the
order and the owner approves it by merging: lantern parts, armour and
charms, home pieces and rest, the first rescue, vendor and coins,
garden, fishing, lore, relics, feats. The rescue comes before the
vendor, who is a rescued person (D-471); collectables come last, as
they reward everything before them. Each may take more than one small
step, with its names and numbers asked at its own step. The first
Light and Hands upgrades may join any of them. Half and Automatic
(Q-069) keep waiting. Also moved D-479 and D-480 to the archive, word
for word, as this file neared 12 KB.

**D-493 · 2026-10-30 · The sixth audit: the newer Version history**
(the owner's picks, all recommended but CLAUDE.md's tidy) The audit at
0.2.207 moves the Version history's 0.2.121 to 0.2.186 word for word
from `history-0.2.js` into `history-0.2-3.js`, nothing visible
changed. D-491 and D-492 move unchanged to `archive/DECISIONS-DROPS.md`;
`CHANGELOG.md` keeps its newest 3 entries; the build plan's ticked steps
9 to 12 move to `archive/PROGRESS-LOG.md`. `CLAUDE.md` is left as it
is. `screens.js` and `main.js` follow at later audits; the next is at
0.2.227.

**D-494 · 2026-10-30 · The vendor begins: selling to the peddler** (the
owner's picks, all recommended; step 13a of D-482, builds D-471 and
D-472) Step 13 starts with selling only; buying from him comes later.
Bumping the peddler at home says his home line, as before, and opens
his card, "PEDDLER": the coins carried and the bag's 6 slots on the
left, the chosen stack's name, count and price on the right, SELL in
the corner, dim for what he doesn't buy. A tap picks a slot; SELL,
Enter or Space sell one of it, free, no turn. He buys only creature
materials so far: each common one for 1 trade coin, each rare one for
5, the price kept in the registry as `sells`. The names stay plain,
"Peddler" and "coins". Coins are kept on a fall in Gentle and Normal
and lost with the world when Hardcore starts over. An older save has
none yet.

**D-495 · 2026-10-30 · Buying from the peddler** (the owner's picks,
all recommended; step 13b of D-482, ends step 13) He sells an oil
flask for 3 coins and a torch for 2, kept in the registry as his
`wares`, and never runs out. His card gets two tabs, Sell and Buy, the
Journal's look; Buy shows his wares in the grid, and BUY, Enter or
Space buy one, free, no turn, dim with too few coins or no room in
the bag, the card saying why. Seeds wait for the garden; recipes
wait for a way to sell them.
