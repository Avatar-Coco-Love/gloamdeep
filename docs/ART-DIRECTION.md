# Art direction

Rules taken from `reference/style-study-1.html` (D-005). The study is
frozen. This file is where the rules live and change. Line numbers below
refer to the study, so read it by range, not whole.

Everything here is a must-keep (D-009). Don't drop or change any of it
without asking the owner. The only planned changes are the two fixes under
"Weak spots to fix" at the end.

## Grid and scale
- Tiles are 16 × 16 pixels. The study room is 11 × 13 tiles (176 × 208 px).
  A 13-pixel text strip sits under it, so the picture is 176 × 221 (D-094).
- Draw at native size on a small canvas, then enlarge it with CSS
  `image-rendering: pixelated`. Use whole-number zoom (2×, 3×) when it
  fits, and fractional zoom only on very narrow screens. Turn image
  smoothing off.
- Every coordinate is a whole pixel. No anti-aliased shapes.

## View: top-down with a slight tilt
- A wall tile whose southern neighbour is not a wall shows a **front face**:
  a 5-pixel dark cap at the top (with a light lip line at y=4), then three
  brick courses (y 5–7, 9–11, 13–14), staggered per row and per tile
  column, with a dark base line at y=15. Other wall tiles show only the
  dark cap, with a light edge on any side that borders a non-wall tile.
- A floor tile directly below a wall gets cast shade on its top 4 rows.
- Sprites sit 2 pixels up from their tile, with a small dark oval shadow
  underneath.
- Study code: lines 177–271 (base layer).

## Palette
Named colours are in the study's `PAL` (lines 121–128). Key roles:

| Role | Colour |
| --- | --- |
| Outline / deepest dark | `#0e0c16` |
| Hero cloak (light, mid, dark, deepest) | `#a6e0e4` `#58a8b4` `#2f6a7c` `#1c3e4e`; a profile may wear one of five more (`src/core/looks.js`, D-275), in one of four shapes of clothes (D-278) |
| Lantern, flame, oil | `#ffd66b` `#f39a3b` `#e9a94a` |
| Lantern trim (cap, base) | `#e8d5a0` `#a8642c`; a profile may pick one of five more (`src/core/looks.js`, D-277) |
| Bone, pale highlights | `#efe6cc` `#b9ab88` |
| Hostile marks (eyes) | `#e8786a` |
| Hero eyes | `#efe6cc`; a profile may pick one of five more (`src/core/looks.js`, D-276) |
| Stairs and unusual things | `#a58ce0` |
| Crypt floor (base, light, mortar) | `#3a4050` `#454c5e` `#22262f` |
| Crypt wall brick (base, top edge, mortar) | `#535d72` `#69748b` `#2b303c` |
| Moss | `#6fb04e` `#3c6e3a` |

Rule to keep: important things (oil, stairs, enemies, the hero) are
recognisable by shape **and** colour, never by colour alone.

## Grey rock (generated depths, D-164)
Code: `src/render/rock.js`. Same view rules as above, but drawn per pixel
from a rock mask whose edges round off and wander in 3-pixel steps. A
floor tile's middle (pixels 4 to 11 both ways) and stairs stay clear.

| Role | Colour |
| --- | --- |
| Cap, grit, edge and face top line | `#1c1f28` `#252935` `#5a6478` |
| Face rock chunks, chunk tops, seams, foot | `#4b5468` `#555e73` `#434b5d`, `#6a7489` `#5f697e`, `#262a35`, `#14161d` |
| Floor, light, dark, pebble | `#363b48` `#404656` `#282c36` `#4a5163` |
| Puddle, shine | `#262d3d` `#3a4660` |

## Earth (burrows, depth 6 and down, D-165)
Same code and rules as grey rock, with its own colours. Wall faces are
uneven bands of rock with dark lines between; half the floor tiles have
a small stone.

| Role | Colour |
| --- | --- |
| Cap, grit, edge and face top line | `#1e1814` `#261e18` `#6e5a48` |
| Face bands, band lines, foot | `#5a4a3e` `#6a584a` `#4e4036`, `#3a2f26` `#2a221c`, `#16110d` |
| Floor, light, dark, pebble | `#3d3229` `#47392e` `#2e251e` `#544435` |
| Stone, its lit top | `#544435` `#6a5848` |

## Dungeon (depth 8 and down, D-228)
The crypt's bricks and slabs as they are, drawn by `src/render/tiles.js`.
Darker, colder bricks are the next step (59c).

## Stairs in grey rock and earth (D-167)
Code: `src/render/tiles.js` (drawSteps). The crypt's five steps and
violet lips, with pale stone steps (light to dark, floor side first;
reversed for stairs up), the opening around them the ground's floor
colour times 0.78, 0.66, 0.55, 0.45, 0.36 by step, inside a 1-pixel rim.

| Look | Steps | Rim |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Grey rock | `#9aa3b6` `#7a8396` `#5a6276` `#3b4152` `#23262f` | `#14161d` |
| Earth | `#b09a7e` `#8e7a62` `#6c5b48` `#4a3d30` `#2a221b` | `#16110d` |

## Light: the core of the look
The study's lighting code is at lines 309–338, plus the light setup inside
`frame()` from line 343.

- Draw the scene at full brightness, then multiply every pixel by the light
  reaching it. Darkness is the default.
- **Light sources:** the hero's lantern (warm, the largest), wall torches
  (orange, flicker more), stairs (faint violet), slimes (faint green).
- **Line of sight:** each light checks visibility in 4 × 4 pixel cells by
  marching rays through the tile grid. Walls block light. A wall is lit
  when the ray reaches it; the ray aims at the wall tile's point nearest
  the light, so a seen wall is lit as a whole tile (D-058).
- **Falloff:** `f = 1 − distance / radius`, raised to the power 1.25,
  then cut into 5 bands with a 4 × 4 Bayer dither. The dithered bands are
  the retro look, so don't smooth them.
- **Lantern colour** multiplier (1.45, 1.2, 0.86). **Torch** (1.2, 0.78,
  0.42). Flicker is a sum of three sine waves (about ±3.5% for the lantern,
  ±9% for torches).
- **Fog of war:** tiles the lantern has reached are remembered and stay
  faintly visible. A tile is remembered when the light reaches its centre
  (D-059). Remembered tiles fade into the dark over 4 pixels in the
  dither (D-060).
- **Each place sets its darkness** (D-063): how dark never-seen tiles are
  and how remembered ones look. A cave with no lights: never-seen pitch
  black, remembered a neutral grey (0.095). The study's values (cold blue
  0.15, 0.16, 0.26 over almost black 0.02, 0.02, 0.045) read as
  moonlight, so they may suit outside at night (Q-027).
- **Emissive layer:** flames and embers are drawn after lighting, so they
  are always bright.
- **Torch mounts** (D-099): on a brick face as in the study; on a wall
  side, a short iron arm out over the open tile, the same flame on top.

## Sprites
- 16 × 16 pixel maps written as strings, one character per palette colour.
  Symmetric sprites store the left half and mirror it. See lines 129–176.
- Each sprite has a white silhouette copy for the hit flash.
- Idle life: 2-frame bob (monsters about 0.4–0.5 s, the hero 0.6 s), and a
  walking bob.
- Next-move marks (D-357): a 5 × 7 arrow or 7 × 4 fangs in the hostile
  pink, outlined in the deepest dark, kept off the creature.

## Small life (keep it subtle)
Swaying torch flames with rising embers. Dust motes that only show where
there is light. Water ripples. A hit flash plus a 1-pixel screen shake on
bump. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`: stop the bobbing, flicker and
drift.

## Weak spots to fix (D-009)
- **The rat sprite** was the weakest piece. Redrawn at step 20 (option A,
  approved by the owner, D-104). Code: `src/render/sprites.js`.
- **Shadow edges** stepped in 4-pixel blocks. Fixed at step 12: edges blend
  over one cell into the dithered bands (D-053). Code: `src/render/light.js`.

## Other notes
- The study's page chrome loads a Google Font. The game itself must not
  (D-003). Game text uses a pixel font drawn in code (D-031): letters 7
  pixels tall, 2 more below for descenders, 1 pixel apart, in
  `src/render/font.js`. Grey `#9790a4` for lines, amber `#ffc65c` for
  warnings (D-094, D-097).
