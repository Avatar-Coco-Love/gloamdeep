# Glossary

The game's words, what each means, and the decision behind it (D-264).
Use these words in the game, the docs and the code, so names stay the
same as the world grows. A new word goes here when it is decided. Where
this page and a decision disagree, the decision wins.

## The journey
- **Journey:** one game, kept on this device, saved after every turn
  (D-019, D-238). Not a "run": the world stays and the journey goes on.
- **Seed:** the number that sets a world's randomness; the same seed
  makes the same world (D-019, D-148).
- **Fall:** what happens at 0 hearts: the hero lies down and wakes at
  the start, keeping their level; the world stays as it was outside
  Hardcore (D-234, D-246, D-332).
- **Gentle, Normal, Hardcore:** the three ways to play, by what a fall
  costs: the bag kept, the bag left where you fell, or one life (D-334).
  Changed in Settings during a journey, only toward easier (D-346).
- **The bag where you fell:** Normal's fallen bag, lying on the floor to
  fetch by walking onto it, marked on the map (D-345).
- **Record:** the deepest depth walked to, kept for good (D-232, D-260).

## The world (more in `WORLD.md`)
- **World, region, cell, room, opening:** see `WORLD.md`, "Words we
  use" (D-169, D-171). In the code a room is a "place".
- **Hearthwood:** the starting region, home in its centre (D-348).
- **Surface:** depth 0, the woods and the way into the crypt (D-233).
- **Depth:** how far down a floor is. **Floor:** all the rooms at one
  depth.
- **Area:** a depth's kind of place: Crypt (1), Cave (2 to 4), Warren
  (5 to 7), Dungeon (8 on) (D-233).

## The hero
- **Hearts:** the hero's health, 5, and up to 5 more bought (D-115, D-293). **LV:** the level (D-246).
- **Embers:** 1 for each level past the first, spent in Growth (D-293).
- **Experience:** a creature beaten gives its hearts and bite; a new room 1 (D-245, D-371).
- **Lantern, oil:** the light the hero carries and what it burns.
- **Flask:** oil to pour into the lantern, from the bag (D-247, D-249).
- **Quick slot:** the round button left of the lantern that pours a flask (D-384).
- **Bag:** what the hero carries, in stacks of up to 20, or 5 of flasks and potions; a kind can fill several slots (D-247, D-333, D-339).
- **Oilcap:** an amber mushroom, the first resource, one in every
  generated room; 3 make an oil flask (D-296, D-299).

  bag, heals 1 heart (D-303, D-308); 3 make a healing potion (D-309).

  bag, heals 4 hearts (D-309).
- **Eat, Drink:** the bag's buttons for a heartcap and a potion (D-308, D-309).
- **Tone:** a mushroom's own slight shift of colour (D-304, D-305).
- **Deposit:** a round grey boulder, 3 in each Cave room; three bumps
  break it for a stone (D-311, D-312).
- **Stone:** a small grey pebble from a deposit, for later crafts (D-312).
- **Wood:** sticks, branches and trees all give it, for crafts and building;
  sticks lie in the woods in three looks (D-314, D-315).
- **Fallen branch:** one in each woods room, blocking a tile; two bumps
  break it for 2 Wood (D-316).
- **Stump:** what a chopped tree leaves; four bumps fell a tree for 3 Wood,
  and the stump grows back into it (D-317).
- **Workbench:** made in the bag from 3 Wood, set down on the surface;
  bigger things are made at it, on its panel, where Deconstruct workbench
  puts it back in the bag (D-314, D-319, D-320, D-322, D-323).
- **Stash chest:** made at the workbench from 3 Wood and 3 Stone, set down
  on the surface, opened by walking into it; each one keeps 12 slots of its
  own, a picked stack moving between it and the bag, and taken down only
  when empty (D-021, D-324, D-325, D-326, D-330, D-331, D-340).

- **Lampmoth:** a pale moth that seeks light, one room a floor on depths 2 to 4 (D-356).

  Tapping one **frames** its creature: amber corners, name and hearts (D-359).

  hearts, level, oil and depth; it fades while the hero is under it (D-378, D-380).

  quests, a bestiary and feats (D-262, D-293); a glass card (D-391).

- **Dev tools:** on for everyone (D-086, `DEV-TOOLS.md`).

## In the code (D-263)

  writes a short list of them, `state.events`; the kinds are listed in
  `src/core/events.js` (D-267).

  name, a look, Records, its play time (D-290) and their own journey (D-268).
- **Slot:** one of the 3 places for a profile; empty or in use (D-268).

  wears: the cloak's colour, the eyes' colour and the lantern's trim (its
  cap and base), six of each, and the clothes, four shapes (Cloak, Belted,
  Short, Tattered), chosen after the name or with Change look (the LOOK
  button) on the slot screen (D-275 to D-278, D-289, D-397); each a glass
  card since D-399.

  registry entry's `ways`, defined in `src/core/behaviours.js` (D-269).
