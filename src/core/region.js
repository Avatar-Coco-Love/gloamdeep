// § region: a generated depth laid out as a grid of rooms (D-169, D-201).
// Plain data, no drawing. Depths 2 to 4 are each a 2 × 2 grid with one cell
// left empty by the seed, so their three rooms make an L, each joined to the
// corner room by a one-tile opening at a spot along their shared edge the
// seed picks. Depths 5 to 7 are warrens: five rooms in a 3 × 3 grid, grown
// as a winding chain (D-227). From depth 8 each is a dungeon: six rooms
// grown the same way, with one more opening that makes a loop (D-228).
// § lining up (D-202, D-203): every floor sits on the same grid. The stairs
// up are in the same cell, at the same tile, as the stairs down one floor
// above; the stairs down in another room than them, at a tile the seed
// picks, which the floor below then fits. Under the crypt the seed picks the
// cell. The room with the stairs up keeps the depth's own id (depth2), the
// others are depth2:x,y.
// § sizes (D-580): the rooms grow with depth, 13 × 15 on the caves' floors,
// 15 × 17 on the warrens', 17 × 20 on the dungeon's. Floors only grow going
// down, so the stairs down always fit the floor below.
// § seeds: the depths moved up one (D-212), but every place below the
// surface keeps the numbers of its old depth, so a seed keeps its rooms (D-213).
