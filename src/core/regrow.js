// § regrow: things picked grow back (D-306, D-307). Each room keeps a `taken` list
// beside its items: the thing just as it lay, its tile and tone, and the turn it
// was taken (`at`). A kind with `regrow` in the registry comes back that many
// turns later, each on its own clock; one without (the knife) never does. It
// comes back only out of the hero's sight, on a tile nothing stands or lies on,
// so nothing appears before their eyes; in a room the hero has just come into,
// what grew while they were away is already there. A tile on the list (a broken
// deposit, O3) comes back the same way, as that tile on the room's map, where the
// floor it left is. Plain data, no drawing.
